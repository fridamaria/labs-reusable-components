# Labs- Reusable Components

Lab assignment during week 16 of the Technigo frontend boot camp.

## The problem

The task was to create a component from scratch that can be reused multiple times in a project. This component is a top app bar that can take different props to conditionally render it. The example includes a menu icon and a title. A link to twitter and a search section are sent to the app bar as children to the ActionItems div.
